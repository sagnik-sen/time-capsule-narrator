Cleopatra: It is almost time. Caesar and Antony will be here any minute. And I will be dead. I knew my time was coming. I know I will die soon. I have lived for so long. I have seen so much. I have lived to know that my enemies will come for me and that I will be dead and gone. I have survived all of their schemes and plots, all their attempts to kill me. I have outwitted them all. I have survived and lived to see the triumph of my people. They will soon be free. I knew that this would happen. I knew that I would have to die. I have lived for so long. I have won. I have won the war. I have won the battle. I have won the war. I have lived. I have lived a good life. I have lived a terrible life. I have lived a tragic life. I have lived. I have lived. I have lived. I have lived. I have lived. I have lived. I have lived. I have lived. I have lived. I have lived. I have lived.
