Cleopatra: I was the last queen of Egypt. I had a mighty empire under my feet, and I was known as the most beautiful woman in the world. My reign was short, but I left behind a legacy that will be admired forever. I will never be forgotten. Antony: What a story, Cleopatra. You were a beautiful woman with a mighty empire. And now you are dead. What happened? Cleopatra: Well, I was captured by Mark Antony, and he had me beheaded in the middle of the streets. Antony was sad, but he had to obey the laws of the Roman Republic, which stated that only a male ruler could be beheaded. Antony: Did you see that? Cleopatra: Yes! Antony was sad, but he was unable to prevent me from being beheaded. Antony: What happened to you after that? Cleopatra: Well, I threw myself into a river. The water was cold, and I thought that would kill me. But, instead, it made me stronger.
