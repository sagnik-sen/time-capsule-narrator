Cleopatra: I am a woman of the world.. I have experienced life to the fullest. I have seen and done things that others dream about. I am now surrounded by my close associates and lovers who have had the pleasure of my company. But I am alone and my thoughts are of my past. Those days that I was young and beautiful and had a destiny. Why did I leave them behind? Why was I forced to go away? Why was I not able to say goodbye to them? I still remember the day when I first saw Antony. I was young and in love, and he was older and wiser. I know that he was in love with me too. But he was married and I was unmarried. I was a young woman who had a choice to make. And I made the wrong choice. And now I am here. In this cold and dark room. My only companion is my reflection in the mirror. It is a sad and lonely existence. I miss my husband. I miss Caesar. I miss my lover. I miss Antony. I miss my friends. I miss my family. I miss my homeland
