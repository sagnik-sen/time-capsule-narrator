Cleopatra: My dear Mark Antony, I am about to follow you into the jaws of death. I know you will miss me, and I will miss you. But there is no use in begging you not to leave me. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg. I will not beg.
